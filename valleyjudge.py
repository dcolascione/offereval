        PERSONAL_EXEMPTION is a tuple of three elements: (AMOUNT,
        PHASE_OUT_BEGIN, and PHASE_OUT_END).  AMT_EXEMPTION is a
        similar phaseout tuple.

        AMT_EXEMPTION and AMT_BRACKETS are used for computing the
        alternative minimum tax, which is used in place of the
        standard federal tax if it comes out to a larger sum.

        FEDERAL_STANDARD_DEDUCTION is the federal standard deduction;
        STATE_STANDARD_DEDUCTION is analogous.

        FEDERAL_BRACKETS is sequences of (RATE, LIMIT) pairs; the last
        LIMIT should be infinity.  These sequences represent the
        various brackets of any progressive (or regressive, since RATE
        does not need to increase) tax scheme.

        MEDICARE_BRACKETS and SOCIAL_SECURITY_BRACKETS are similar
        data structures for medicare and social security
        rates, respectively.

        STATE_STANDARD_DEDUCTIONS, STATE_BRACKETS, and
        STATE_SSDI_BRACKETS are dictionaries mapping each state
        abbreviation to structures analogous to the similarly-named
        federal concepts.  The Taxes class independently tracks income
        earned in each state.

        INCOME_EVENTS is a sequence of (STATE, DATE, AMOUNT) tuples;
        these tuples represent income of any sort.  We need to know
        total income because the effective tax rate depends on total

    is a sequence of numbers, which must sum to one, that determine
    how much of the grant vests in each year.  START_DATE is a
    datetime.date object indicating when the grant clock starts
    ticking.  VESTING_DATES is a sequence of (MONTH, DAY) tuples that
    indicate the months and days when grants vest each year.

    Return a sequence of (VDATE, VAMOUNT) tuples; each VDATE is a date
    on which a vest happens; and VAMOUNT is the amount, in dollars,
    given out on that day.

    ARGV is the program's argument array; you want to use sys.argv.
    OFFERS is a sequence of Offer objects.

    START_DATE is the day you expect to start working.  NR_YEARS
    is the number of years to graph.  OUTPUT is the stream to
    which to write the gnuplot file.

    TAXES is a function of one argument, a sequence of earnings days,
    that returns a Taxes instance that can answer questions about tax
    liability over the time represented.  You usually want to use the
    default, the Taxes2016 subclass of Taxes.  If TAXES is None, do
    not compute tax information; pre-tax figures will be graphed.

    PAYDAYS is a list of day-numbers indicating the days of the month
    one receives paychecks.

    ALREADY_EARNED_FIRST_YEAR and ALREADY_EARNED_STATE are an amount
    of dollars earned in the year on which you accept the offer and
    the state in which you earned that money, respectively.
    These figures are optional: they help fine-tune tax calculations.

    SERIES is a sequence of strings giving things to graph.
    The options are "total", "equity", "cash", and "tax".

    SERIES_STYLES is a mapping from series name to gnuplot line style.
    It can control the way different lines look.  All lines pertaining
    to a single offer are plotted in the same color.

    TITLE is the title of the graph.

    If SHOW_DOLLARS is true, as it is by default, the graph is labeled
    with dollar amounts.  If false, the graph does not show specific
    dollar levels.  Setting SHOW_DOLLARS to false is useful if you
    want to generate a graph showing the relative values of various
    offers without revealing exactly how much you're making.
